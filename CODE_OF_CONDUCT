### Teamwork

If we do not work together, the effect of this will be that the project is more stressful and difficult. So, if someone is not working on the project, we should have a team conversation about this. Depending on what the group decides about the ammount of work they are not participating in, the team will talk to Professor Luman and propose a certian ammount of points that we think they should lose on the assignment. Of course, before we do this official conversation with the Professor, we will talk to the team member and give them an opportunity to catch up. This seems like a good idea.  

### Content

`TODO`

## Bot behavior

If the bot is not behaving well, we will immadiately stop it from tweeting until we can fix the problem. We will also delete any objectionable tweets.
