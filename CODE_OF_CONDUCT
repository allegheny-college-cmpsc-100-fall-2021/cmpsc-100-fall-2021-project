The bot should act under the same expectations as a normal, decent user. It should not say anything harmful towards anyone or say anything that would be condescending towards any groups of people. The bot should also add something positive to the platform, even if it's slight entertainment. 

## Consquences

- Report to professor if teammate is not contributing
- Have person do other work to make up for missed work or meetings

### Teamwork

Failing to contribute meaningfully (in a timely fashion) may result in being subjected to group intervention
Regular meaningful contributions will result in a plethora of positive emojis on the group chat

### Content

Harassing content will result in bot being taken down--temporarily or permanently

## Bot behavior

Bot behaving in desired way will result in bot maintaining its existence--yay!

- Everyone can work on their own but you should contribute to the group as a whole
- When you finish work, let everyone know what you have done
- Let the group know when you cannot do something and make sure to have a good excuse
- If the group is unable to complete a certain portion of the work make sure to catch up on doing it and forget about it for later.
- Help another group member out on a portion of their work they may need help on

This will be a civilized bot refraining from offensive content.

If a member fails to answer or work with group multiple times, group intervention will occur followed by taking it to the professor if it continues to happen.
If the bot behaves at it is supposed to then it may continue living under our circumstances.

Every little bit that is added/updated will help the code in some way and in the long run!

### Teamwork

If the team does not work together, it will take more time for our project
to get done. It may also lead to people having overlapping code that may 
hinder the program. Positive consequences of working together will have the 
opposite effect of the afforementioned results. We will get our program done
faster and at a higher quality.

### Content

If something offensive is tweeted, the bot could be taken down. Hashtagging and "@"ing users could bring complicity that is unneeded. If the tweet is not enjoyable, users got become upset and report the account. 
* You can do your own work but everyone has to make a contribution to the project 
* Everyone has to have the same amount of commitment to the project

* Needs to reference other third-party sources if we are going to use one 

### Content

## Bot behavior

If we do not work together, the effect of this will be that the project is more stressful and difficult. So, if someone is not working on the project, we should have a team conversation about this. Depending on what the group decides about the ammount of work they are not participating in, the team will talk to Professor Luman and propose a certian ammount of points that we think they should lose on the assignment. Of course, before we do this official conversation with the Professor, we will talk to the team member and give them an opportunity to catch up.  

### Content

## Bot behavior

If the bot is not behaving well, we will immadiately stop it from tweeting until we can fix the problem. We will also delete any objectionable tweets.
