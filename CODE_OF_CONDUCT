# Course Project Code of Conduct

This document proposes the following areas for definition. They are the product of class collaboration to define them. Students should feel free to propose new areas of consideration and content.

## Teamwork guidelines

Meet group-decided deadlines
Everyone makes meaningful contributions

## Tweet content

Above all, do no harm
Anticipate ways in which bot could be manipulated/taken out of context

## Bot behavior

Bot should not follow or mention other Twitter users un-provoked

## Consquences

### Teamwork

Failing to contribute meaningfully (in a timely fashion) may result in being subjected to group intervention
Regular meaningful contributions will result in a plethora of positive emojis on the group chat

### Content

Harassing content will result in bot being taken down--temporarily or permanently

## Bot behavior

Bot behaving in desired way will result in bot maintaining its existence--yay!
