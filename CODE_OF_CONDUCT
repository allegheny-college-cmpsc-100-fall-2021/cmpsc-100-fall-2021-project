This will be a civilized bot refraining from offensive content.

## Consquences

If a member fails to answer or work with group multiple times, group intervention will occur followed by taking it to the professor if it continues to happen.
If the bot behaves at it is supposed to then it may continue living under our circumstances.

### Teamwork

Each member will contribute their amount of work that is decided by the group as a whole to contribute to the project as a whole.
Every little bit that is added/updated will help the code in some way and in the long run!
