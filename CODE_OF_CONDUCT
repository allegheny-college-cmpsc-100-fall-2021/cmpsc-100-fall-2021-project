# Course Project Code of Conduct

This document proposes the following areas for definition. They are the product of class collaboration to define them. Students should feel free to propose new areas of consideration and content.

## Teamwork guidelines

- Our team should meet once a week on a specific day.
- Our team will turn work in on Thursday at midnight every week in order to make deadlines.
- Have a team groupchat that is active
- Everyone shares the work equally and pulls their own weight

## Tweet content

- Do not infiltrate a hashtag
- Do not tag a person who is not following the bot 
- Do not use offensive language
- Do not repeat tweeting the same tweet
- Do not tweet false news

## Bot behavior

- No spam
- Do not immitate another account
- Do not follow people who do not follow the bot
- Do not randomly tag another account
- Do not randomly direct message another account

## Tweet content

## Bot behavior

The bot should act under the same expectations as a normal, decent user. It should not say anything harmful towards anyone or say anything that would be condescending towards any groups of people. The bot should also add something positive to the platform, even if it's slight entertainment. 

## Consquences

- Report to professor if teammate is not contributing
- Have person do other work to make up for missed work or meetings

### Teamwork

- Everyone can work on their own but you should contribute to the group as a whole
- When you finish work, let everyone know what you have done
- Let the group know when you cannot do something and make sure to have a good excuse
- If the group is unable to complete a certain portion of the work make sure to catch up on doing it and forget about it for later.
- Help another group member out on a portion of their work they may need help on

### Content

* Meet at least once a week 
* Submit any recent changes for the project on Thursday so other team members could see and discuss 
* Have a team groupchat that is active 
* Everyone has to have an equally shared amount of work 


## Tweet content

* Do not infiltrate a hashtag
* Do not tag anyone who's not following the bot  
* Do not use offensive language 

## Bot behavior

* Do not spam 
* Do not imitate any accounts
* Do not follow people who's not following the bot

## Tweet content

Make sure tweets include language that won't be offensive to any users. The content of each tweet should be enjoyable for all users. The tweet won't be long, but whatever message it conveys should make logical sense. For safety purposes, do not hashta anything or "@" anyone.

## Bot behavior



## Consquences

* Last resort: complain to professor 
* Have person to do other work to for missed work or meetings 

### Teamwork

If the team does not work together, it will take more time for our project
to get done. It may also lead to people having overlapping code that may 
hinder the program. Positive consequences of working together will have the 
opposite effect of the afforementioned results. We will get our program done
faster and at a higher quality.

* You can do your own work but everyone has to make a contribution to the project 
* Everyone has to have the same amount of commitment to the project

### Content

* Needs to reference other third-party sources if we are going to use one 


### Content

If something offensive is tweeted, the bot could be taken down. Hashtagging and "@"ing users could bring complicity that is unneeded. If the tweet is not enjoyable, users got become upset and report the account. 

## Bot behavior


If we do not work together, the effect of this will be that the project is more stressful and difficult. So, if someone is not working on the project, we should have a team conversation about this. Depending on what the group decides about the ammount of work they are not participating in, the team will talk to Professor Luman and propose a certian ammount of points that we think they should lose on the assignment. Of course, before we do this official conversation with the Professor, we will talk to the team member and give them an opportunity to catch up.  

### Content


## Bot behavior


If the bot is not behaving well, we will immadiately stop it from tweeting until we can fix the problem. We will also delete any objectionable tweets.
