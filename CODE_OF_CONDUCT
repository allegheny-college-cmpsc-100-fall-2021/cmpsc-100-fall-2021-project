# Course Project Code of Conduct

This document proposes the following areas for definition. They are the product of class collaboration to define them. Students should feel free to propose new areas of consideration and content.

## Teamwork guidelines

Group members should generally be completing work according to how it's divided and should be communicating with other group members throughout the process. Work should be completed by due dates set ahead of time by groups; if you're unable to do so, let the group know with enough notice ahead of time if possible. The group will tentatively meet Wednesdays from 12:30pm-1:30pm in the Alden library (rm. 109) unless otherwise specified. Just about everything should be finished by December 8th (only small bugs should be left; not everyone will be able to work on the project past this date). If we come up with any other guidelines at any time, we can add them to this.
