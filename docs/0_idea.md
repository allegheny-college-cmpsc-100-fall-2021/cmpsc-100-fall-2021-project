# Course project idea

## Title

Novelty time project

## Description of project

Novelty measures of time could include 30 second commercial slots or how long it would take the avergae person to read certain books, class times, or even tv show episode lengths. To make it a little easier we are  going to have it tweet every hour and the event would be a random holiday

### Classification

Place an `x` in the appropriate `[ ]` below.

- [ ] Uncreative
- [ ] Procedural
- [x] Data-driven
- [x] Graffiti

### If you plan to use any data sources, what are they and why?

We plan to use kaggle because it has a bunch of run times for netflix shows and other movies so we can use it as a plan of attack to start our project

### Tentative description of ideal output
the output would be a bot that tweets out random holidays and a format of time we want to use to describe how many of whatever time measurement we use till whatever holiday is coming

## Statement of motivation/interest

we thought it'd just be a funny thing to get other students in the mood for the holiday spirit and it aslo spurs inspiration from bots that we had learned from our bots lesson

## Perceived or realized challenges

I think the challenges we'll face are going to be getting data, putting it together and how big we think the code will be 

## Comment below on the ethical challenges that your concept faces.

Ethical challenges that I think our group will face is probably jusy setting times to meet up and work on our project
